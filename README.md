    currentAppStoreID: "123456789" // Filters out current app
)
```

#### App Showcase Data Format

Create a JSON file with your app information:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-03T00:00:00Z",
  "apps": [
    {
      "id": "myapp",
      "name": "My App",
      "briefDescription": {
        "en": "An amazing app for productivity",
        "zh-Hans": "ÊèêÈ´òÁîü‰∫ßÂäõÁöÑÊÉä‰∫∫Â∫îÁî®",
        "ja": "ÁîüÁî£ÊÄß„ÇíÂêë‰∏ä„Åï„Åõ„ÇãÁ¥†Êô¥„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ„Ç¢„Éó„É™"
      },
      "appStoreID": "987654321",
      "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "iPadOS"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Coffee Tips Setup

To enable in-app purchase coffee tips:

1. Set up your in-app purchase products in App Store Connect
2. Pass the product IDs to the `coffeeTips` parameter:

```swift
AppAboutView.fromMainBundle(
    // ... other parameters
    coffeeTips: ["com.yourapp.coffee1", "com.yourapp.coffee3", "com.yourapp.coffee5"]
)
```

The framework automatically handles:

- Product loading and purchasing via StoreKit
- Thank you alerts after successful purchases
- Graceful error handling
- Localized coffee tip button names ("Buy me a coffee", "Buy me 3 coffees", etc.)

### Localization

The framework includes comprehensive localization support:

- **Supported Languages**: English (base), German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese
- **Automatic Detection**: Uses device language settings with fallback to English
- **Custom App Data**: Support for localized app descriptions in showcase data
- **Bundle Integration**: All strings use `.module` bundle for proper SPM integration

### Platform Support

- **Supported Platforms**: macOS 15+, iOS 17+, tvOS 17+, visionOS 1+
- **Platform-Specific Features**:
  - iOS: In-app App Store integration for showcase apps
  - macOS: External App Store links, native color schemes
  - tvOS & visionOS: Optimized UI layouts and interactions
  - Adaptive UI elements and spacing across all platforms

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **AppAboutView**: Main SwiftUI view with platform-specific styling and StoreKit integration
- **AppShowcaseView**: Displays developer's other apps with platform tags and navigation
- **AppShowcaseService**: `@MainActor` service managing app data loading and caching
- **MyAppInfo**: Data models for app information with localization support

### Caching Strategy

- **Local Bundle**: Ships with apps.json for offline functionality
- **Remote Updates**: Fetches from provided URLs with 1-hour cache refresh
- **Debug Mode**: Always fetches fresh data during development
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation from remote ‚Üí cached ‚Üí local data

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0+ / iOS 17.0+ / tvOS 17.0+ / visionOS 1.0+
- Swift 6.0+
- SwiftUI
- StoreKit (for coffee tips feature)

## Testing

The framework includes a comprehensive test suite covering:

- **Component Tests**: Initialization and configuration validation
- **Data Model Tests**: JSON parsing and localization logic
- **Service Tests**: App showcase data loading and caching
- **UI Tests**: Screenshot testing for visual regression detection

Run tests with: `swift test`
