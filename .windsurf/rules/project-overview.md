# AppAboutView Project Rules

## Project Overview
AppAboutView is a SwiftUI package that provides a reusable "About" view component for macOS and iOS apps. It displays app information, handles user interactions (feedback, ratings, coffee tips), and showcases other apps by the developer.

## Core Principles
- Multi-platform support (macOS and iOS)
- SwiftUI-first architecture
- Localization support (7 languages)
- Service-based data management
- Resource bundling for app showcase

## File Structure Rules
- Never create files unless absolutely necessary
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation if explicitly requested
- Please ignore CLAUDE.md since it's made for Claude Code
